                I designed a component for a transportation company's mobile app, as a part of their restructing initiative for their whole system. 
                My role was to "gamify" functions that were mundane and procedural, and I did so through a system that educates and encourages the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was the sole UX Designer for this part of the project. 
                I laid out a timeline for my project manager and made sure we hit each goal every week, while staying in constant contact to see if our course of action may shift.
                My vision for the component was this: When it sensed a moving violation on the road, it would send the driver a message saying not just what they did, but how to improve and prevent the problem. Before this, many of the users did not like the app–they felt it was intrusive. Making this app a tool instead of torture was my goal.

                There was research already gathered and I asked my manager lots of questions. Sometimes critical requirements are found outside of the research. One of them being that users could only perform one action at a time for this app. This helped me keep the interactions lean and focus on the users' boundaries.
                 I placed all of the interactive elements towards the right or center. Since our base as using this products as they were driving, I wanted to make the buttons more accessible for them.
                
                
            </p>
            <p>
                The mobile app connected to a larger system through a RESTful API. On the administrative side of the app, one could see the whole group's actions and incidents. I designed a system that showed how many incidents occured within a team, as opposed to indiviual users. This encouraged cohesion among the group. As they see their totals incidents as a team decrease, each person would have more trust in their coworker's ability and pride in their performance.
